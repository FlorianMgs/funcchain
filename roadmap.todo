[ ] - override global settings inside chain()

[ ] - retry on pydantic validation error

[ ] - depends functionality to create nested chains and compile into runnables
        # add a deps thing to put into funcchain defs that takes another chain and compiles it into a runnable
        # so langsmith shows nested chains
        # in the chain creation process it just runns all of the depending chains in parallel and feeds the inputs into sub chain
        # output of every chain is string when inserted

[ ] - vector retrieval type to add file/url context into chains

[ ] - implement variable compression to inject as much context as possible without overloading
        # Create a Compressable Context Schema where it is compressed in case the context lenght is already filled
        # So anything that is additional can be compressed to fit in the context but when other things that are important are not compressed.
        # Optionally you can define how to compress and where to leave the gaps (default in the middle with [...])
